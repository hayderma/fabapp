Please note the following regarding email:

when you place the PHPMailer folder, first make sure that you place it inside the queue folder.
Also make sure that you don't place the upper lever too, meaning when you unzipp it(zipped version attached here), the unzipped folder tree will be like :
PHPMailer -> PHPMailer -> Files inside PHPMailer

so just copy the lower lever PHPMailr folder

PHPMailer -> Files inside PHPMailer
NOT PHPMailer -> PHPMailer -> Files inside PHPMailer
